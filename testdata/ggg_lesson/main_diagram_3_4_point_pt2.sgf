If White does attach under the marked stone (triangle) with 3, he will have fallen for Black's 'trick' in this opening. As shown in this diagram, if White plays at 3, Black promptly cuts at 4, splitting White's stones and challenging White to a fight inside Black's sphere of influence. This is what Black was hoping for all along.  <strong> White's moves at 7 (this is the key move) and 9 are a clever technique for managing the emergency and are worth remembering.</strong> The continuation through to 15 is a sort of joseki (White captures the triangle stone with 15). However, I don't think it's good for White in this game.

Looking at the result, even though White has managed to capture a stone and get out of immediate danger, the position still favors Black. Black A is well positioned to exert a subtle pressure on White's group and erase its influence. Even though White looks thick now, the group could later become heavy.])
