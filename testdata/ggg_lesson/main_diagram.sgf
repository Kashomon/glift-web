Now let's return to the original problem diagram. I'll state my conclusions first - to make it easier for you to follow along - but it will take a fair bit of analysis to explain them so please bear with me.

According to classical Go theory, approaching the lower right corner is the biggest move for White now, because it stops Black from finishing a position there by playing A. White's most common move in the corner is also A, though B is often played by people who want to keep the game simple. In my opinion, both <strong> A and B are ineffective in this opening and will make the game uncomfortable for White. </strong>

White C, on the other hand, is a special technique for approaching the 5-4 which is particulrly effective when the opponent builds a formation extending from the 5-4 stone, as Black has done in this game. White D is also a strong move, which calmly gives White a good position while keeping the game simple for now.  White E and F are also interesting moves to experiment with, but we don't have space to discuss them today.])
