Entering the corner at the 3-3 point is an aggressive strategy, which aims to swiftly take territory while making Black's right side position inefficient.  Look at the variations to see how it works.]

This makes Black's earlier exchanges of A, White B, Black C look questionable.

Next, Black will play at D.  See the variation for details.]

;W[dj]LB[di:A][en:B][fp:C]C[In compensation, Black does get some influence across the bottom side and in the moves through to here, Black forms a solid territory. On the other hand, White controls three corners and has built a framework on the left side of the Go Board.

When you think about it for a bit, Black's only territory is at the bottom, which nearly all of Black's moves being concentrated there. This isn't particularly efficient, so <strong> White needn't be jealous of this territory and needn't worry about trying to invade it. </strong>

This last move could also be at A.  In this game, Black is very strong at the bottom, so I'd prefer to play a bit more conservatively and make it harder for Black to stir up trouble on the left side.

You may be wondering about White B. Isn't that a weird move? It gives Black territory with Black C, but maybe Black is entitled to that territory?])
