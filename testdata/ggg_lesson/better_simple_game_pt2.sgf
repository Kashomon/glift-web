Here's another interesting way of playing which Younggil pointed out to me when I showed him the draft of this article.

White creates an even stronger position at the bottom (but loses sente). Playing this way is nice because it turns White's bottom group into a kind of launchpad from which invasions at A, B and especially C can easily be supported. <strong> This is an example of storing power which can be released during later attacks.</strong>

I really like this approach of splitting the bottom. It is simple, but it is powerful. Depending on your style, either of the last two diagrams are good for White. There's still one more technique I'd like to cover though, which is invading at the 3-3 point.])
