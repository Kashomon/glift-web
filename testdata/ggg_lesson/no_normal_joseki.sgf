;B[rr]C[<strong> Can't white just play the normal joseki? </strong>

In this case, no. See the variations for why. The 'normal' joseki (or at least the variation play by amateurs) backfires superbly. Once again, this is exactly what Black was hoping for.]

;W[mq]LB[pj:B][pl:A]TR[qm][qn][qo]C[<strong> Because of the nature of this position, Black can go all out attacking White's three stones on the right side by playing at A. </strong> This makes things incredibly difficult for White and the best option for White now would be to leave the three stones for now and defend the bottom.

You can see that Black's right-center stort point stone (B in the diagram) is working beautifully to make this attack possible.])
