So you're probably wondering why White shouldn't play at the 3-4 point, right? Let's cover that first.

If White enters the corner at 3-4, Black can respond with a nice knight's move press (triangle stone in the diagram). As we saw earlier, this move attempts to enclose White in the corner and is quite natural.

In this case, White can't easily trade the corner for the outside as I showed earlier because Black has already made a position on the right side. So, if White wants to respond locally, the best options are A, B, or C. I'll discuss why A isn't a good move below.

White C is sometimes playable, but is usually a bit slack because it seems like White has been forced into a low position on the second line. If White plays C, Black would follow up later with D or E.  Black will choose between these depending on what Black wants to achieve.

White B is a better move. In fact, it's the best continuation once White plays at the 3-4 point. However, the final result isn't particularly good in this opening and it leads to a position that is favorable for Black.
