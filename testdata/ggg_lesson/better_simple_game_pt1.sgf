Here's a better way to keep the game simple. Compare the diagram to the ones we've just looked at. I'm sure you'll be able to feel how much more comfortable White's group is.

Yes, I know it's another two space group. In some ways this does look very similar to the diagram previously where I said that White was uncomfortable. So what's the difference? There are two key points to take not of here:

1. White's group has moved two points to the left, which reduces the value of Black 2 and restricts the scope of Black's lower left star point significantly.

2. There are two spaces separating White 3 and Black 4. This doesn't look like much, but it does a great deal in limiting Black's ability to attack White severly. Again, <strong> try to get a feel for how much more 'room to breath' white has here </strong>])
