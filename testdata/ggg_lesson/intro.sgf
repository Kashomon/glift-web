In this lesson, we're going to learn about 5-4 openings. First, you will see some lecture slides, and at the end, you will be given some problems to try out to see how well you absorbed the content.

The lesson was originally created by David Ormerod and Younggil An of GoGameGuru and reproduced in its current form by Josh Hoak.  Most of the comments hereafter are by David and Younggil An, but they have been abridged and modified somewhat to fit this format.

The problems at the end are the work of Josh Hoak.])
